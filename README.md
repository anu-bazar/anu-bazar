## 👩🏻‍💻 About me

Hello, my name is Anu 👋🏻

Thanks to freeCodeCamp, I started to teach myself Javascript and then learned Python at school as a bioinformatician.

As I enjoyed it a lot and wanted to learn more, I decided to step further by joining a Bootcamp at Code First Girls, to become a Software Developer.
